A6Part3 - Compute amount of inharmonicity present in a sound

Write a function that measures the amount of inharmonicity present in a pitched/harmonic sound. The 
function should measure the mean inharmonicity in the sound over the time interval t1 to t2.

The input argument to the function are the wav file name including the path (inputFile), start (t1) 
and end time (t2) of the audio segment to compute inharmonicity, analysis window (window), window 
size (M), FFT size (N), hop size (H), error threshold used in the f0 detection (f0et), magnitude 
threshold for spectral peak picking (t), minimum allowed f0 (minf0), maximum allowed f0 (maxf0) and 
number of harmonics to be considered in the computation of inharmonicity (nH). The function returns 
a single numpy float, which is the mean inharmonicity over time t1 to t2. 

A brief description of the method to compute inharmonicity is provided in the Relevant Concepts 
section of the assignment pdf. The steps to be done are:
1. Use harmonicModelAnal function in harmonicModel module for computing the harmonic frequencies and 
their magnitudes at each audio frame. The first harmonic is the fundamental frequency. For 
harmonicModelAnal use harmDevSlope=0.01, minSineDur=0.0. Use harmonicModelAnal to estimate harmonic 
frequencies and magnitudes for the entire audio signal.
2. For the computation of the inharmonicity choose the frames that are between the time interval 
t1 and t2. Do not slice the audio signal between the time interval t1 and t2 before estimating 
harmonic frequencies. 
3. Use the formula given in the Relevant Concepts section to compute the inharmonicity measure for the 
given interval. Note that for some frames some of the harmonics might not be detected due to their low 
energy. For handling such cases use only the detected harmonics to compute the inharmonicity measure. 
All the detected harmonics have a non zero frequency.

In this question we will work with a piano sound ('../../sounds/piano.wav'), a typical example of an 
instrument that exhibits inharmonicity 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_acoustics#Inharmonicity_and_piano_size). 

If you run your code with the default values of the input parameters the returned output should be 
1.1448. Setting nH = 5 and nH = 15, while other input parameters are set to their default values 
results in an inharmonicity measure of 0.8814 and 1.4908, respectively.

Optional/Additional tasks
An interesting task would be to compare the inharmonicities present in the sounds of different instruments. 
Furthermore, you can also compare inharmonicity measure for different notes of the piano. For example, 
you can choose t1 = 2.3 and t2 = 2.8 for the same piano sound (time segment with a higher note being 
played compared to t1= 0.1 and t2 = 0.5).
